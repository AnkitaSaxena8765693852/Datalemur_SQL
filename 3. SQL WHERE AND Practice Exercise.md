# SQL WHERE AND Practice Exercise

#### Let's practice using AND along with WHERE to filter Amazon reviews based on all 4 of these conditions:
1. the review should have 4 or more stars
2. the review ID is less than 6000
3. the review ID is more than 2000
4. the review can't come from user 142

### `reviews` Table:

|   Column Name |	Type    |
|---------------|-----------|
|review_id	    |   integer |
|user_id	    |   integer |
|submit_date	|   datetime|
|product_id	    |   integer |
|stars	integer |   (1-5)   |

### `reviews` Input:

| review_id | user_id | submit_date         | product_id | stars |
|-----------|---------|---------------------|------------|-------|
| 6171      | 123     | 06/08/2022 00:00:00 | 50001      | 4     |
| 7802      | 265     | 06/10/2022 00:00:00 | 69852      | 4     |
| 5293      | 362     | 06/18/2022 00:00:00 | 50001      | 3     |
| 6352      | 192     | 07/26/2022 00:00:00 | 69852      | 3     |
| 4517      | 981     | 07/05/2022 00:00:00 | 69852      | 2     |

``` sql
SELECT * 
FROM reviews
WHERE stars >= 4
AND review_id > '2000' AND review_id < '6000'
AND NOT user_id = '142';
```
