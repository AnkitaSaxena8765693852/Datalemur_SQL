# SQL IN Practice Exercise

#### Imagine you are a Data Analyst working at CVS Pharmacy, and you had access to pharmacy sales data. Use the IN SQL command to find data on medicines:

    1. which were manufactured by either Roche, Bayer, or AstraZeneca
    2. and did not sell between 55,000 and 550,000 units

Output the manufacturer name, drug name, and the # of units sold. for all the medicines which match that criteria.

## `pharmacy_sales` Table:

| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| product_id    | integer |
| units_sold    | integer |
| total_sales   | decimal |
| cogs          | decimal |
| manufacturer  | varchar |
| drug          | varchar |

## `Pharmacy_sales` Sample Input:


| `product_id` | `units_sold` | `total_sales` | `cogs`    | `manufacturer` | `drug`           |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| 9            | 37410        | 293452.54     | 208876.01 | Eli Lilly      | Zyprexa          |
| 34           | 94698        | 600997.19     | 521182.16 | AstraZeneca    | Surmontil        |
| 61           | 77023        | 500101.61     | 419174.97 | Biogen         | Varicose Relief  |
| 136          | 144814       | 1084258       | 1006447.73| Biogen         | Burkhart         |

``` sql 
SELECT manufacturer,
       drug,
       units_sold
FROM pharmacy_sales
WHERE manufacturer IN ('Roche', 'Bayer', 'AstraZeneca')
AND units_sold NOT BETWEEN 55000 AND 550000;
```

## Output

| manufacturer | drug           | units_sold |
|--------------|----------------|------------|
